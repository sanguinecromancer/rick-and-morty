From the rick-morty directory:
    npm run setup-project
    npm run dev

This will create a both frontend (localhost:5173) and backend (port:5100) server.

I have created a profile and hardcoded sample email and password, but you can also create your own account.

I use MongoDB database with Mongoose, the database is in Atlas cloud and user and in .env you can find the database connection string.
